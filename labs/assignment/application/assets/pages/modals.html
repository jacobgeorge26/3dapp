                    <li>
                        <p>The project was setup and maintained in GitHub. The link to the repo can be found in the footer.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The Costa cup model was created in Blender instead of 3DS Max, requiring a different workflow and a deeper understanding of X3D to successfully get the model working.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A more complex animation was created to allow users to make the model fall over, as opposed to just making it rotate.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>More complex interaction with the models was implemented to change the speed of the animations. Additionally, the texture can be shuffled to another product (with the texture links stored in json) and are switched to a solid colour in wireframe mode (black in light mode, white in dark mode).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The css was improved beyond the labs, with a dark mode implemented. This stores the hex codes for the colours in json and updates the values of the variables that the css is using in :root.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Clarification: This is not a deeper understanding point, but to clarify how the data content is loaded. Some of the data (e.g. descriptions) is loaded from the SQLite DB, whilst some (e.g. urls) is stored in a json file. If the DB does not return the data that an element is looking for then it defaults to the data in the json file, which is intended to be a less up-to-date version of the DB for such elements.</p>
